## Foreword
### Implementation of a Minimal Ray Tracing System

Each basic machine learning system in principle comprises 3 stages:
- **Training** where the entire ML models' parametra are estimated with help of training data (data + groundtruth).
- **Testing** where test data is classified, and
- **Evaluation** where the testing results are evaluated by comparison with the groundtruth.

In this exercise, you will build a __minimal__ classification system by implementing these three tasks. To make this easier, you are provided with a basic machine learining framework so that you just have to __fill in__ the missing core parts.
- Download and install [CMake](https://cmake.org)
- Download (, build) and install [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) library
- Fork the current repository
- Using CMake generate the solution for miniml for your favorite IDE (_e.g._ Microsoft Visual Studio or XCode)
- Check that you can build and run _miniml_
- Do the assignment
- Add new folder "renders" to repository and save there the resulting renders (_i.e._ resulting class maps)
- Submit assignment by making a pull request

The provided machine learning framework contains a number of useful C++ classes, which you will need for the practical exercises:
- OpenCV class Vec3b, which incorporates standard vector operations such as addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, _etc._
- In order to handle and save image data, an OpenCV class Mat is included that handles pixels of type Vec3b. Pixels are stored in BGR (Blue, Green, Red) format, where each color component ranges from 0 to 255. For example, black=(0, 0, 0), white=(255, 255, 255), red=(0, 0, 255). With function imwrite(String& fileName, Mat& img) image data is saved into file. The bmp, jpg, _etc._ file formats are supported. See main.cpp on how to use this class.
- A class CPDFHistogram  is provided for handling all PDF relatied procedures: sequential build, probability estimation, _etc_. Internally PDFs are stored as one-dimensional histograms.
- Furthermore a class CBayes implements the naive Bayes Model for classification (that we have studied on the lectures). It has a method ```addFeatureVec``` for sequential estimation of the Bayes model parameters and method  ```getNodePotentials``` for classifying the test data.

## Problem 1
### Feature Extraction (Points 10)
We will start with extracting features from the images into the feature vector. For sake of simplicity the features were already calculated and are stored in the 001_fv.jpg and 002_fv.jpg files as red, green and blue channels. In order to solve the first problem please fill the feature vectors in the Training and Testing procedures in main.cpp file. The feature vector is a single channel column-matrix. It has nFeatures columns and 1 row. 

In order to check your implementation, the first feature vector of the 001_fv.jpg should be equal to [132, 12, 73]

> **Hint1:** In order to access pixels of a gray-scaled image ```img``` you can use OpenCV method ```img.at<byte>(y, x)```, where x and y are coordinates of the pixel. 

> **Hint 2:** In order to access pixels of an RGB color image ```img```, you can use OpenCV method ```img.at<Vec3b>(y, x)``` and to access the distingct color values: ```img.at<Vec3b>(y, x)[c]```, where c is the channel index from 0 to 2.

## Problem 2
### Class Prior Probability (Points 25)
In order to apply the Bayes model we need to estimate the prior probabilities and the likelyhoods from the training data. In this exersise we will estimate the prior probabilities. For this purpose we will use class `CPDFHistogram`. This class is designed to store, estimate and represent PDFs via histograms. Please study its implementation in the provided framework.

In `CBayes` class the prior probability is declared via smart pointer `std::shared_ptr<CPDFHistogram> m_pPrior;`, please see how it is initialized in the class constructor. In method `CBayes::addFeatureVec()` implement estimation of the prior probability. 

> **Hint:** Test your implementation with the `printPriorProbabilities()` function: if your implementation is correct, the output will be: `17.2%   0.4%    59.5%   9.9%    13.0%   0.0%`

## Submission
Please submit the assignment by making a pull request.
**Important** : Please make sure that
- No _extra files_ are submitted (except those, which were mentioned in the assignment)
- The changes were made _only_ in those files where you were asked to write your code
